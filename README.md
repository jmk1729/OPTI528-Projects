# OPTI528-Projects
Most of the code here will probably be simulations using AOSim2, authored by Johanan L. Codona, PhD from Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona.  This seems like a good way to partition project workload and keep remote correspondence open, so we'll give it a try.

If you are on here and not one of our collaborators, please see JLCODONA/AOSIM2 for license information on using AOSim2 software
