MATLAB-based Adaptive Optics simulation

Most of this code is the property of Johanan L. Codona, Ph.D.
I have included some code from the MathWorks web site to compute Zernike polynomials and Mark Milton's code to compute disk harmonics.  
Also, I have included mfitsio for convenience.  I will try to clean up parts of this repo wrt licenses.  If in doubt, ask.  

See the license file for more details.
